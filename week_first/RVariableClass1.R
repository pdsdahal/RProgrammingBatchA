#R- variable creation 

#starting with undrscore(_) is not a valid variable
#_collegeName = "Texas"

#Starting with number is not a valid variable
#1data <- 1000

#Vairable name should be meaning full. I recommend to use camel case like below. 

collegeName <- "ABC College"
collegeName

num1 <- 10L
